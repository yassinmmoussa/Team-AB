# Software Accessibility
As suggested by https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-make-websites-accessible, "By law, you must make new and significantly refreshed public websites accessible if you are:
* a private or non-profit organization with 50+ employees; or
* a public sector organization

The organization that controls the website must meet the accessibility requirements.

In order to make the software accessible, we needed to comply with [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) which "is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international team of experts."

Utilizing [PowerMapper](https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/checks/accessibility-checks/), an online tool to check the software's eligibility of the WCAG standards. We were able to get a better understanding of how our software holds. Here is what the scan has checked for:
